        <div class="allinfo">
            <div class="Basic Output">
                <h2>Basic OutpuT</h2>
                <p>std::cout is the “character output stream” and it is used to write to the standard output. It is followed by the symbols << and the value to be displayed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="js">
                <h2>Single-line Comments</h2>
                <p>Single-line comments are created using two consecutive forward slashes. The compiler ignores any text after // on the same line.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="mtd">
                <h2>while loop</h2>
                <p>A while loop statement repeatedly executes the code block within as long as the condition is true. The moment the condition becomes false, the program will exit the loop. <br>

                    Note that the while loop might not ever run. If the condition is false initially, the code block will be skipped.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lib">
                <h2>Libraries</h2>
                <p>A for loop executes a code block a specific number of times. It has three parts: <br>

                  <br>  1. The initialization of a counter
                   <br> 2. The continue condition
                   <br> 3. The increment/decrement of the counter </p>
            </div>
            <div class="str">
                <h2>parameters</h2>
                <p>Function parameters are placeholders for values passed to the function. They act as variables inside a function.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mth">
                <h2>function</h2>
                <p>A function is a set of statements that are executed together when the function is called. Every function has a name, which is used to call the respective function..</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mthfr">
                <h2>Calling a Function</h2>
                <p>In C++, when we define a function, it is not executed automatically. To execute it, we need to “call” the function by specifying its name followed by a pair of parentheses ().</p>
            </div>
            <div class="str">
                <h2>Function Declarations in Header file</h2>
                <p>Function declarations are generally stored in a header file (.hpp or .h) and function definitions (body of the function that defines how it is implemented) are written in the .cpp file.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="assign">
                <h2>Functions Definitions</h2>
                <p>
                    In C++, it is common to store function definitions in a separate .cpp file from the main() function. This separation results in a more efficient implementation.
                    
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="var">
                <h2>Function Overloading</h2>
                <p>
                    In C++, function overloading enables functions to handle different types of input and return different types. It allows multiple definitions for the same function name, but all of these definitions must differ in their arguments.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="decvar">
                <h2>Inline function</h2>
                <p>An inline function is a function definition, usually in a header file, qualified by the inline keyword, which advises the compiler to insert the function’s body where the function call is. If a modification is made in an inline function, it would require all files containing a call to that function to be recompiled.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="strcon">
                <h2>Function templat</h2>
                <p>A function template is a C++ tool that allows programmers to add data types as parameters, enabling a function to behave the same with different types of parameters. The use of function templates and template parameters is a great C++ resource to produce cleaner code, as it prevents function duplication.</p>
