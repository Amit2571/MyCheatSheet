                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>
                    Comments are bits of text that are ignored by the compiler. They are used to increase the readability of a program.
                    
                 <br>  1. Single line comments are created by using //.
                 <br>  2. Multi-line comments are created by starting with /* and ending with */.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="js">
                <h2>Classes</h2>
                <p>
                    
                           A class represents a single concept.

                        A Java program must have one class whose name is the same as the program filename.

                        In the example, the Person class must be declared in a program file named Person.java.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="mtd">
                <h2>Java instance</h2>
                <p>
                    Java instances are objects that are based on classes. For example, Bob may be an instance of the class Person.
                    
                    Every instance has access to its own set of variables which are known as instance fields, which are variables declared within the scope of the instance. Values for instance fields are assigned within the constructor method.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lib">
                <h2>Constructor Method in Java</h2>
                <p>
                    Java classes contain a constructor method which is used to create instances of the class.
                    
                    The constructor is named after the class. If no constructor is defined, a default empty constructor is used.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="str">
                <h2>Reference Data Types</h2>
                <p>Reference Data Types
                    A variable with a reference data type has a value that references the memory address of an instance. During variable declaration, the class name is used as the variable’s type.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mth">
                <h2>Constructor Signatures</h2>
                <p>
                    A class can contain multiple constructors as long as they have different parameter values. A signature helps the compiler differentiate between the different constructors.
                    
                    A signature is made up of the constructor’s name and a list of its parameters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mthfr">
                <h2>Method parameters in Java</h2>
                <p>
                    In java, parameters are declared in a method definition. The parameters act as variables inside the method and hold the value that was passed in. They can be used inside a method for printing or calculation purposes.
                    
                    In the example, a and b are two parameters which, when the method is called, hold the value 10 and 20 respectively.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="str">
                <h2>Declaring a Method</h2>
                <p>
                    Method declarations should define the following method information: scope (private or public), return type, method name, and any parameters it receives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="assign">
                <h2>Array creation in Java</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, an array can be created in the following ways:
                    
                    Using the {} notation, by adding each element all at once.
                    Using the new keyword, and assigning each position of the array individually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="var">
                <h2>Modifying ArrayLists in Java</h2>
                <p>
                    An ArrayList can easily be modified using built in methods.
                    
                 <br> 1.  To add elements to an ArrayList, you use the add() method. The element that you want to add goes inside of the ().
                    
                  <br>2.  To remove elements from an ArrayList, you use the remove() method. Inside the () you can specify the index of the element that you want to remove. Alternatively, you can specify directly the element that you want to remove.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="decvar">
                <h2>The public and private keywords</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, the keywords public and private define the access of classes, instance variables, constructors, and methods.
                    
                    private restricts access to only the class that declared the structure, while public allows for access from any class.</p>
